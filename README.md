## 🌍 What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of building systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as:

- understanding language
- recognizing images
- making predictions
- learning from data
- generating content
- making decisions

### Types of AI

- Weak AI / Narrow AI: Built for a specific task, such as spam detection or chatbot responses.
- Strong AI: A hypothetical form of AI that could perform any intellectual task a human can do.

## 🧠 AI vs ML vs Deep Learning vs GenAI

```text
AI
├── Machine Learning
│   └── Deep Learning
└── Generative AI
```

- AI is the broad field.
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset where systems learn patterns from data.
- Deep Learning uses neural networks with many layers to solve complex problems.
- Generative AI creates new content such as text, code, images, and audio.

---

## 📚 Core Data Concepts

### Structured vs Unstructured Data

- Structured data: Organized in rows and columns, such as CSV or SQL tables.
- Unstructured data: Free-form data such as text, documents, audio, images, and video.

### Labeled vs Unlabeled Data

- Labeled data: Includes the correct answer or category.
- Unlabeled data: Does not have predefined labels.

### Metadata

Metadata is information about data. For example, a document may have metadata such as title, author, and date.

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Foundations

Machine Learning enables a model to learn patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed for every rule.

### Common ML Types

- Supervised Learning: Learn from input-output examples.
- Unsupervised Learning: Discover hidden patterns from unlabeled data.
- Reinforcement Learning: Learn through trial and error using rewards and penalties.

### Important ML Concepts

- Training data: Used to teach the model.
- Features: Input variables that the model learns from.
- Model: The trained program used to make predictions.
- Training: The process of teaching the model.
- Inference: Using the trained model on new data.
- Evaluation: Measuring whether the model performs well.

### Example

A spam filter is a supervised learning problem:

- Input: email text
- Output: spam or not spam
- Training data: many emails with labels

---

## 🧠 Deep Learning Foundations

Deep Learning uses neural networks with many layers to solve more complex tasks.

### Neural Networks

A neural network is inspired by the human brain and learns patterns by adjusting weights through data.

### Popular Architectures

- CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks): Best for images and computer vision.
- RNNs / LSTMs: Used for sequences like speech or time series.
- Transformers: Powerful architecture used in modern LLMs.

### Example

Image classification is a classic CNN use case.

---

## 👁️ Specialized AI Domains

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP helps machines understand and generate human language.

Examples:

- sentiment analysis
- chatbot responses
- translation
- summarization

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision teaches machines to understand visual content.

Examples:

- face recognition
- object detection
- medical image analysis

### Speech AI

Speech AI enables systems to work with voice input and output.

Examples:

- speech-to-text
- voice assistants
- text-to-speech

## 🔄 AI System Lifecycle

```mermaid

    A[Collect Data] --> B[Prepare Data]
    B --> C[Train Model]
    C --> D[Evaluate Model]
    D --> E[Deploy Model]
    E --> F[Monitor & Improve]
```

A real AI project usually follows this lifecycle:

1. Define the problem
2. Collect and prepare data
3. Build and train the model
4. Evaluate performance
5. Deploy the solution
6. Monitor and improve it

---

## 🧱 Generative AI and LLMs

Generative AI creates new content rather than simply classifying or predicting.

Examples:

- writing emails
- generating code
- creating images
- summarizing documents
- answering questions

### Key LLM Concepts

- Tokenization: Breaking text into pieces called tokens.
- Embeddings: Turning words or pieces of text into numerical vectors.
- Attention: Helping the model focus on important parts of input.
- Transformer: A modern neural network architecture used by most LLMs.

### Example Prompt

```text
Prompt: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points."
```

A well-designed prompt often gives better results.

---

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art of designing effective instructions for AI systems.

### Good Prompt Example

```text
You are a helpful AI tutor.
Explain the difference between supervised learning and reinforcement learning in simple terms.
```

### Why it matters

- improves relevance
- reduces ambiguity
- guides the model toward better output

---

## ⚠️ Common LLM Challenges

### Hallucination

A model may generate confident but incorrect information.

### Bias

Models can reflect bias present in training data.

### Latency and Cost

Larger models may be slower and more expensive.

### Quality Control

AI systems need evaluation, testing, and monitoring.

---

## 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines retrieval of relevant information with generation by an LLM.

### Why RAG is useful

Instead of relying only on the model’s memory, RAG allows the model to look up external documents first.

### RAG Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[User Question] --> B[Retrieve Relevant Documents]
    B --> C[Pass Context to LLM]
    C --> D[Generate Answer]
```

### Key Components

- Document loader
- Text chunking
- Embeddings
- Vector database
- Retriever
- LLM

### Example Use Case

A chatbot that answers questions from company documents, PDFs, or manuals.

---

## 🗂️ Vector Databases and Embeddings

A vector database stores embeddings so that relevant items can be found using similarity search.

### Why this matters

It allows systems to search by meaning, not just exact keyword match.

### Example

If a user asks: "What is the refund policy?"

The system can retrieve documents that are semantically related, even if they do not contain the exact phrase.

---

## 🤖 Agentic AI and MCP

Agentic AI refers to systems that can plan, use tools, and complete multi-step tasks with some level of autonomy.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is a way to give AI models structured access to tools, external systems, and data sources.

This is especially useful for:

- tool calling
- workflow automation
- multi-step reasoning
- connecting LLMs to real-world systems

---

## 🛠️ AI Engineering Workflow

An AI engineer usually works across several layers:

1. Problem definition
2. Data collection and cleaning
3. Model selection
4. Training and evaluation
5. Deployment
6. Monitoring and improvement

### Important Practices

- version control
- testing
- experiment tracking
- monitoring
- reproducibility
- responsible AI
